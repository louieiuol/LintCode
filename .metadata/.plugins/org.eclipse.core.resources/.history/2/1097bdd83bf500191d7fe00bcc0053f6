//24. LFU Cache
//中文English
//LFU (Least Frequently Used) is a famous cache eviction algorithm.
//For a cache with capacity k, if the cache is full and need to evict a key in it, 
//the key with the lease frequently used will be kicked out.
//Implement set and get method for LFU cache.
//
//Example
//Input:
//LFUCache(3)
//set(2,2)
//set(1,1)
//get(2)
//get(1)
//get(2)
//set(3,3)
//set(4,4)
//get(3)
//get(2)
//get(1)
//get(4)
//
//Output:
//2
//1
//2
//-1
//2
//1
//4
