//892. Alien Dictionary
//中文English
//There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.
//
//Example
//Example 1:
//
//Input：["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
//Output："wertf"
//Explanation：
//from "wrt"and"wrf" ,we can get 't'<'f'
//from "wrt"and"er" ,we can get 'w'<'e'
//from "er"and"ett" ,we can get 'r'<'t'
//from "ett"and"rtff" ,we can get 'e'<'r'
//So return "wertf"
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input：["z","x"]
//Output："zx"
//Explanation：
//from "z" and "x"，we can get 'z' < 'x'
//So return "zx"
//Notice
//You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
//You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
//If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
//There may be multiple valid order of letters, return the smallest in normal lexicographical order
